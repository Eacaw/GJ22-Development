# Game Jam 2022

## Theme: "Death is only the beginning"

### Updates:

#### Day 1:

Theme announced at 9pm local time, so we had a brief brainstorming session before calling it a night.

#### Day 2:

Initial planning completed with the team. Game theme is based on Dante's inferno and utilises the player _killing themselves_ to progress through a set of levels. Basic player movement added within a basic tunnel view (3d platform style). Basic title screen included with start button that brings you to dev space

#### Day 3:

A lot of prefabs were added today (button, door). Leaving your original body was also added and can be done by pressing [E]. UI interfaces were created for the end of the level as well as a pause menu that allow for navigation to other screens/scenes.

#### Day 4:

Created 8 basic levels that can be utilized for the game. Add more details to the `DevPlayground` and features such as a ramp. Update the UI at the end of each level to progress to the next level in the build.
