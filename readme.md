# Game Jam 2022

## Theme: "Death is only the beginning"

### Updates:

#### Day 1:

Theme announced at 9pm local time, so we had a brief brainstorming session before calling it a night.

#### Day 2:

Initial planning completed with the team. Game theme is based one Dante's inferno and utilises the player _killing themselves_ to progress through a set of levels. Basic player movement added within a basic tunnel view (3d platform style). Basic title screen included with start button that brings you to dev space
