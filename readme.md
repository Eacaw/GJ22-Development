# Game Jam 2022

## Theme: "Death is only the beginning"

## Updates:

### Day 1:

Theme announced at 9pm local time, so we had a brief brainstorming session before calling it a night.

### Day 2:

Initial planning completed with the team. Game theme is based on Dante's inferno and utilises the player _killing themselves_ to progress through a set of levels. Basic player movement added within a basic tunnel view (3d platform style). Basic title screen included with start button that brings you to dev space

### Day 3:

A lot of prefabs were added today (button, door). Leaving your original body was also added and can be done by pressing [E]. UI interfaces were created for the end of the level as well as a pause menu that allow for navigation to other screens/scenes.

### Day 4:

Created 8 basic levels that can be utilized for the game.

Added some more assets to the project, including a ramp/wall that the player must use their bodies to climb.

DevPG has been extended and will become the first level of the game once we have the remaining missing assets.

Also fixed a bug wherein the player could force themselves to stick to a wall, resolved by adding a frictionless material to the player. Nice little bonus here that we were able to add a little bounce to the player. Fixed up the level a bit and updated the door/frame model to match the walls exactly.

Attempted to include a new player model, but rotation issues have put that to one side for now, contemplating sticking with the original model.
