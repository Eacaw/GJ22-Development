## File structure

### Assets

This is the top level folder for assets, all subfolders will be in here.

### Scripts

This is the top level folder for scripts, we can discuss how to structure this at a later point.

### Scenes

This folder houses all of our unity 'scenes' think of these as levels, we can transition between them to switch levels

### Prefabs

Prefabs are our friends, prefabs are chunked up components, with their scripts and settings neatly bundled up for reuse.

### Materials

Materials can be either brought in from outside (with a library) or created in the editor directly, we can explore our options with this a lot more later down the line.

#### I am sure there's going to be more

Update this file as we go along.
